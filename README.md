## How to

### Create a new post

Create a new file in the [_post folder](https://github.com/DryFly-TheShortFilm/DryFly-TheShortFilm.github.io/tree/master/_posts).

The file name must be something like *2016-07-11-summa-3d.md* where *2016-07-11* is the date and *summa-3d* will appear in the URL post.
DON'T FORGET: .md 

The file must start with a [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) that looks like

```
---
layout: post
title: Summa 3D
tags:
  - margarito
  - dryfly
  - 3D
  - Animación
  - premio
description: >
    Margarito arrasa allá donde va
---
```

It must contain:

1. `layout: post`
2. `title` with a verbatim title that will appear at the beginning of the post
3. `tags`: provided as a list
4. `description`: with a post description, it is recommended to put a pretty long description

The article is written in Markdown format that is really similat to plain text, and it is translated in HTML when you save hitting the **Commit changes** button at the bottom of the page.
